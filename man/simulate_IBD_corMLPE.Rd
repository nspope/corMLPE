\title{Simulate data from an isolation-by-distance model with MLPE correlation structure}
\usage{
simulate_IBD_corMLPE(sets = 1, elements = rep(10, sets), intercept = 0,
  slope = 0.5, random_effects = diag(2), correlation = 0.25,
  residual_sd = 1, distances = NULL, seed = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sets}{number of distinct sets (e.g. species) containing elements that are compared}

\item{elements}{vector, number of elements (e.g. populations, individuals) in each set}

\item{intercept}{intercept of regression line}

\item{slope}{slope of regression line}

\item{random_effects}{variance-covariance matrix for random intercepts/slopes per set; ignored if sets==1}

\item{correlation}{parameter of MLPE correlation structure; between 0 and 0.5}

\item{residual_sd}{standard deviation of (correlated) errors}

\item{distances}{optional; list of distance matrices (one for each set), or a single distance matrix if sets==1; if absent, locations are simulated from a 2d uniform distribution}

\item{seed}{random seed used to simulate data}
